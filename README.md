## Profile
**Theoretical Condensed Matter Physicist** interested in using high performance parallel computing to numerically model topological materials such as Dirac and Weyl semimetals as well as superconductor-semiconductor heterostructures. Currently conducting research into quasi-particle excitations arising in these materials and the application to topological quantum computing. An effective oral and written communicator with publications in major scientific journals along with presentations on original research at multiple scientific conferences. Independent and collaborative work skills gained through joining multiple scientific groups and managing processes in a manufacturing engineering setting.

## Research
### Topological Condensed Matter
*Clemson University – Clemson, SC* (2014-2019)

- Showed that partially separated Andreev bound states (ps-ABSs) arise as generic low energy modes in superconductor-semiconductor heterostructures. When separated by a distance of the order of the characteristic Majorana decay length, these ps-ABSs give an identical signal to “garden variety” Majorana Zero Modes (MZMs) for a large range of control parameters in localized charge tunneling experiments.

- Outlined a two-terminal charge tunneling experiment capable of differentiating between ps-ABSs and MZMs. This research is valuable to researchers attempting to create topological quantum computers because the braiding calculations used in these computations rely on MZMs which are localized to the ends of the semiconducting nanowire. Without running the proposed experiment or one similar to it, there is no way to be certain that the system is in a topological phase supporting true MZMs.

- Computed the Nernst coefficient (conventional as well as anomalous) for the recently discovered Dirac Semi Metal Cd3As2 using Boltzmann dynamics within the relaxation time approximation. Showed that the spin degeneracy in the two four-fold degenerate Dirac points can be lifted by a magnetic field, producing four doubly-degenerate Weyl points with a non-vanishing Chern number. Showed that the Nernst response in this material is dominated by the anomalous Nernst effect and hence can be used as a direct probe of the Berry curvature.

### Jammed Granular Matter
*University of Rhode Island – Kingston, RI* (2013-2014)
- Used configurational statistics to show profiles of pressure, mass density, and entropy of disks in narrow channels jammed by gravity and centrifuge. Calculations led to publication, with applications to granular matter under conditions which create heterogeneous mass distributions. Created a mathematical model in Mathematica to simulate the system.

### Materials and Nanotechnology
*North Dakota State University – Fargo, ND* (May–July, 2010-2012)

- Worked with a team to create a method of purifying colloidal nanoparticle samples into monodisperse layers using density-gradient-ultracentrifugation. Dry nanocrystal films were created and characterized using highly monodisperse silicon nanocrystals, leading to a significant enhancement in photoluminecence over polydisperse samples.

- Assisted in the creation of a cryogenic system which measured temperature dependent photoluminecence in silicon nanoparticles using optical microscopy as well as spectroscopy.

- Set up a system to capture video microscopy of phase separation in polymer-nanocrystal mixtures. Constructed a program using Matlab which tracks particles in a solution.

### Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Data Analysis
*Minnesota State University Moorhead – Moorhead, MN* (2010 - 2011)

- Data from a published study was modeled to measure proton-proton interactions. Separations were found to be unusually small, results were presented at Student Academic Conference.

- Developed system to record and control temperature of a sample in a student built NMR machine. Program was written in LabView to provide a user interface used to monitor and control temperature of the NMR probe via temperature controller.

## Industry Experience
